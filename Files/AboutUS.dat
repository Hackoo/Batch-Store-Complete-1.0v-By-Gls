This Project" /c 0x0B /d " 'BATCH-STORE'" /C 0x07 /d " is a Collaborated Contribution of 'TheHacker' members..
Where, The main idea of creating this Store came from 'DOCS2'. They asked, 
if this kind of App in Batch is possible? The idea seems interesting and Probably
feasible to my eyes (Gls). So, We started Discussing it.

And, 'Sounak@9434' has also contributed by providing the main Core Plugins for the
Batch-store. And, to implement the idea - I (Gls) worked hard for about a week in
the coding.

&, If You'll Notice the Beautiful GUI of BATCH-STORE - All the design, Suggestion
& Innovation in the theme, Layout, Placement, Loading etc. etc. are Created by my
Brother - Doc2 (Wollvo) - www.wollvo.com. So, The Batch-Store is mainly
